# Vermeer-Attributions: Current and Historical

With its Digital Art History Lab [DAHL]( https://www.frick.org/research/DAHL), the Frick Art Reference Library seeks to encourage the use of digital tools in art historical inquiry. By providing datasets, workshops, and access to tools, the DAHL hopes to facilitate the collaboration between art historians and scholars from a variety of fields. The datasets presented are related to works of art currently or once attributed to Vermeer.

The dataset contains 203 works of art that were once or are currently attributed to the seventeenth-century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675). At present, only thirty-five paintings are considered authentic. With this dataset, art historians may uncover hidden connections of provenance, attribution, style, and more between the thirty-five authentic Vermeers and the 168 other paintings, which range from forgeries and misattributions to lost or contested works. The dataset was created with a spirit of exploration and experimentation for those wanting a dataset with which to explore digital art history tools.

When possible, each entry in the Vermeer dataset includes information regarding alternate titles, rejected attributions, provenance, current location, date, image links, material, dimensions, signatures and inscriptions, citations, and exhibition history. This information has also been broken up into smaller datasets of works of art formerly attributed to Vermeer, lost works by Vermeer, an inventory of the Dissius Auction of 1696, and more. Some records still need to be completed: Library staff will continue researching and enhancing these records in the upcoming months.

The datasets are available in CSV format and JSON. We have used the standard UTF-8 encoding for our CSV files. The data in each file is identical. Both forms are provided for your convenience.
